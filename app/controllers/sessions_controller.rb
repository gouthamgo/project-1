      # other controller variables) This stateful/persistent memory across
      # requests is implemented using browser cookies: this server will
      # send a 'set-cookie:' header with in the response headers for this
      # page, which it is the browser's job to store, and then also to present
      # to the server again in all future request headers....
      # i.e. the browser will remember that we have already logged in

      # The flash hash is a bit like 'session' in that it is remembered
      # across page requests... but ONLY for the next page load, and not
      # beyond that. This allows us to show error messages on e.g. login
      # forms when there's been a problem, but the message doesn't stay
      # around after the next reload.
